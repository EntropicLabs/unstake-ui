# Unstake UI

The frontend for https://unstake.fi, rewritten.

## Getting started

We use [bun](https://bun.sh) as the package manager and runtime.

To run the site in development mode, run the following commands:

```bash
bun install # Install dependencies
bun --bun run dev # Run vite dev server in the bun runtime
```

We use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, and [MeltUI](https://www.melt-ui.com) component builders.
